##Reporting Issues##

Have you identified a reproducible problem in this repo? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

##Look For an Existing Issue##
Before you create a new issue, please do a search in open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

👍 - upvote

👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

##Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests##
File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful in reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- OS
- The version of Node.js, npm / yarn
- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring
- A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally
    - **Note**: Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.
- Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

##Thank You!##
